dadi simulation (with example based on BGI_1.0 and ZJU1 reference)
basically, there are two steps for replicating dadi simulations:
first, repeatly generate input files of dadi by sampling from SNP callling files(obtained by using GenerateSNPfilefromvcffile.py or GenerateSNPfilefromvcftable.py for vcf files or sql snp databases for populations, respectively)
This's been done through the process: using a sql outer-join like function, merge all selected population vcf files into a big snp table, and sample sites from it then produce dadi input file for each sampling.(detail see article methods)
we proveded an example file m_sp_sx_pk_gy_lcb_jd_sm_ytg_kbe_fanyaonly_newdilutetodensity0.01(BGI_1.0) that is produeced from such process and can be used to conduct the results presenting in article through the below step.
second step,
using the following commands to simulated the mallard and domesticated spliting under 'split_mig_1_IM' model(detail see code) with each parameter assigned the 
lower bound,initial value, upper bound for the model and with the lenghth those snp from and with number of repeated times.
command: python2 life/src/NGS/Analysis/usedadiPy2_7/dadicode.py -n mallard14 26 -n quantizpool 24 -f m_sp_sx_pk_gy_lcb_jd_sm_ytg_kbe_fanyaonly_newdilutetodensity0.01 -m split_mig_1_IM -p nuA 2 1e-05 50 -p s 0.5 0 1 -p TA 0.3 1e-06 10 -p TS 0.1 1e-06 5 -p m12 0.5 1e-06 8 -p m21 0.5 1e-06 8 -T m_d -l 480650.4721472733 -b 100 20

This command can be repeated called by the wrapper bootstrapdadisimulation.py but with random initial values for parameters of the model.
wrapper will automately collected all the simulated estimates and all the arrays for the head map pictures(the dadi code is modified,mainly 'plotting.py', to output the heatmap values. src can be found in this repos and build in your mechine)

As we mentioned in recent editon submitted to a journal, we replicate most analyses on newly widely used reference ZJU1 and included more recently published duck WGS data to confirm our results. Anayses procedures were recorded in our anayses engine and corresponding data and scripts can be found in server host throgh our granted path way to visit. Or contact us for the code and more details to replicate our research. Here present some original exploration records that we didn't organized:

    This command produce dadi input file and quantized all vcf files of '-q' parameters into one 178(+1) individuals 'quantizpool' population (last columns of both Allele1/Allele2) in the dadi input file. That is 9 domestic vcf represented 11 domestic populations (newdomesticbreedslcwhitelcwhitelcwhite23.indvd.vcf are 8 domestic breeds regarded as one population)

    Beside using ZJU1 as reference, the other difference compare to our previous work on BGI_1.0 reference is that we used additional two (nine actually, as newdomesticbreedslcwhitelcwhitelcwhite23 comprise 8 breeds) domestic populations. results looks like consist with our previous inference that divergence time between domestic lineages and mallard/spot-billed are longer than it between mallard and spot-billed. slightly difffernce on the exactly value may due to model difference(split_nm,split_m were the model presented in paper), data sets diffferences, random, or other errors.
    
    try to use the orignal samples to see whether the additonal domestic samples will have obvious influence on the divergence time. we mannully quntified those samples' allele frequencies into one domestic population,quantiz7pop.

Our this article last time was reject due to a reviewer claims that our findings have been reported in somewhere else for one reason, which is not true and they published later than ours preprint version. During the past submission history, I feel this issue is still not well accepted by the community that time and back-to-back research and additional further research are reasonable. The improved version is presented here, Welcome to communicate about technology and academia. The source code for this project was intended to be open, and it was indeed made public in the past, having been cloned by many. However, due to some misconduct that has undermined the integrity of academic communication and harmed our interests, access to the source code is now restricted to users known to us, access to the source code is now restricted to user who we know.
