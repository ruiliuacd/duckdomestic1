dadi is a powerful method for fitting demographic models to genetic data.

Binary installers are available for OS X and Windows. If you use a binary installer, we still suggest downloading the source, so as to get the documentation, examples and tests.

To install from soruce, simply run `python setup.py install`.

After that, run a (growing) series of tests on the installation. Change to the `tests` directory and run `python run_tests.py`

Usage examples are found under the `examples` directory.

Additional documenation is under the doc directory. To view the API documentation, open doc/api/index.html in a web browser.

To stay updated on dadi's development, go to dadi.googlecode.com and sign up for the (low-traffic) dadi-announce mailing list.

Please post questions to the dadi-users mailing list, so we can build up an archive of useful tips.
